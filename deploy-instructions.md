# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy your mobile app to GitHub Pages:

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository "mobile-app"
4. Leave the repository as public
5. Do not initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these files)
6. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Update Your Configuration

1. Open `package.json` and replace "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME" with your actual GitHub username
2. Open `README.md` and replace "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME" with your actual GitHub username

## 3. Push Your Code to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal (replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/mobile-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

After pushing your code to GitHub, run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will build your app and deploy it to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.

## 5. Configure GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
4. Make sure the source is set to the "gh-pages" branch
5. Your site will be published at https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/mobile-app/

## 6. Access Your App

Your app will be available at:

https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/mobile-app/

You can access it from any device, including your phone!
